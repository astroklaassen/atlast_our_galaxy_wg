# collaborative_working

This is a template work space for AtLAST working group collaboration.

## Checklist for using this space:
1) If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to make one: https://github.com/join
2) Request to join the repository as a collaborator: email the working group coordinator or the owner of this repository (their username is indicated above) including your GitHub username in the email, and the name of the repo you would like to join.
3) Accept the invitation that arrives via email - note: you need to be logged in to GitHub to see this!
4) Explore the workspace! Check out the "projects" tab above for a to-do list, and the "wiki" tab. Add your name to the collaborators list.

Depending on your familiarity with git, you can either edit the wiki, projects and files in-browser, or you can clone this repository & work locally with your usual git workflow, committing changes regularly. Working groups should come up with a workflow - this could involve each member creating a branch to make changes, and doing a pull request to merge.

If you're new to using git & GitHub, here's a suggested workflow for editing things in-browser: [GitHub workflow](https://github.blog/2013-07-11-github-flow-in-the-browser/)

The readme.md files and wiki are formatted in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

There is a file storage limit on each repository, so this is *not intended as a place to store large files such as data!* Please keep this space for meeting notes, to-do lists and code including LaTeX files. We suggest you host data, large plots and pdfs etc. externally and add links to them here. You can add links in markdown, however bear in mind that these repositories are all public.
